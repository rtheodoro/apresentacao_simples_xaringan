# Para usar o timer (countdown) é precis utilizar o pacote countdown,
# Eu só consegui instalar ele fazendo o download direto do github do criador
# https://github.com/gadenbuie/countdown e instalando com devtools::instal_local()

#      after_body: ["insert-logo.html", "timer.html"]

countdown::countdown(15, 0, top = "1.5%", style = "z-index:100", update_every = 1,
                     font_size = "100%", warn_when = 300,
                     color_running_background = "#E5E5E5")



# and then delete everything in the HTML file except for the <style>, <script>, and <div> tags related to countdown (also delete the <html>, <head> and <body> tags, too), ... you can include this in the slides doc in the after_body:
# 
# output:
#   xaringan::moon_reader:
#     includes:
#       after_body: timer.html
# 
# and you'll end up with a timer that sticks to the bottom right corner throughout your slides.
# 
# Note that if you use timers inside your presentation, then you only need to keep the <div class="countdown"> html and it should be picked up by the scripts/styles defined in your slides.
